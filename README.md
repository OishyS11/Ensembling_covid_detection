# Ensembling_covid_detection
This approach focuses on classification of COVID-19 among three classes (COVID19/pneumonia/normal) and four-classes (COVID19/normal/viral pneumonia/bacterial pneumonia) using multi-network ensembling approaches. The ensembling is executed using two methods (decision fusion and feature concatenation).
